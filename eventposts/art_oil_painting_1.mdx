# Oil Painting for Beginners

This class is meant to be a basic overview of oil painting for absolute beginners who may have wanted to start practicing with oil paints but donn't know where to start. In this class, Jessica will go over basic materials that you'll need to get started without spending a fortune! The rest of the lessons will be about making simple 3-5 value studies that will allow you to get a better sense of moving the paint on a surface and controlling value ranges to create simple pictures. While there are literally tons of ways to paint with oils, this will be a basic 'primer' class to help those get started.

## Oil Painting Blurb from Wikipedia

Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time.
